# Apa-Aja.bot

I made this bot because of a hobby, feel free to fork it and add other functionality to the bot.

This is a simple Node.js based discord bot, all the commands and events are located on src folder.

## Deployment Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm start` for production and `npm run dev` for development.
